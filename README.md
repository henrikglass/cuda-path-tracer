# cuda-path-tracer
cuda-path-tracer is a naive path tracer implemented using CUDA C++. It was started as a spare time project for me to learn more about graphics programming and GPGPU computation. Please keep in mind this project isn't really designed for anyone to use as an actual tool. There is no front-end; nothing even close to it. You are however free to do anything you want with the code, as long as it's compliant with the MIT license.
